I always wanted a website where I can keep a log of what is going on in my professional (programmer) life and now I took the time and effort to set it up.

It  isn't even close to being up to date and that is why I am promising myself publicly that I'll work on making it great and include any tutorials that I feel are worthy of sharing.
