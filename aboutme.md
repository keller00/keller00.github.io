My name is Mark Keller.  

I am a University of Waterloo alumni, from Canada who is currently working at Snowflake. I like to learn and do new things on my computer.  

I speak many languages, such as: Python:heart:, Scala, C, C++, Java and even more.

I have worked on many of my own projects, which can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/keller00/).
