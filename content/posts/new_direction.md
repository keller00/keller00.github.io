A lot has happened in my life since I posted on this blog. I graduated from school,
moved across the continent, entered the workforce, got a dog, my first tattoo and
got a lot of new hobbies.

However; something never changed. In the back of my head I was always thinking about
posting more on here.

I also found a real passion of mine: mentoring. I feel like I have accumulated some
wisdom by now and I would like to pass this on to whoever comes across my website, or
just be able to collect my thoughts on different topics to easily be able to send
them to others.

So I want to repurpose the blog. I want to post about more than just coding. While it
is still something that I enjoy in my free time, I don't do it as much as I used to in
2018.
